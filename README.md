###Approach to Create the RECALL.IT Prototype
NT Concepts, Inc. created the RECALL.IT prototype in response to GSA RFQ 4QTFHS150004 using agile development methods, tools and staff based on our successful experiences on other agile efforts. 
RECALL.IT is a working development and design prototype (Pool Three Full Stack) using datasets from http://open.fda.gov. Our approach to create the RECALL.IT prototype followed our established agile practices and the US Digital Services Playbook.
