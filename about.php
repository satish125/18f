								<h1>RECALL.IT</h1>
								
								<p>RECALL.IT is a open source dashboard primarily for federal health inspector use that displays FDA recall data (circa 2004-2015) for foods, drugs, and devices. Users can view recall data statistics, filter the data by geographic area (city/state), and view specific details about the data in a sortable, filterable, and exportable table format. Its purpose is to give the federal health inspector a daily snapshot of current events, as well as provide historical insight to past recalls.</p>
								
								<p>Recalls are almost always voluntary, meaning a company discovers a problem and recalls a product on its own. Other times a company recalls a product after FDA raises concerns. Only in rare cases will FDA request or order a recall. But in every case, FDA's role is to oversee a company's strategy, classify the recalled products according to the level of hazard involved, and assess the adequacy of the recall. Recall information is posted in the Enforcement Reports once the products are classified.</p>

								<h2>Understanding General Recall Classifications</h2>
								
								<p>These guidelines from <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm049070.htm#RecallClassifications" target="_blank">FDA 101: Product Recalls</a> categorize all recalls into one of three classes, according to the level of hazard involved:</p>
								
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Class I</strong>: Dangerous or defective products that predictably could cause serious health problems or death. Examples include: food found to contain botulinum toxin, food with undeclared allergens, a label mix-up on a lifesaving drug, or a defective artificial heart valve.</li>
									<li><strong>Class II</strong>: Products that might cause a temporary health problem, or pose only a slight threat of a serious nature. Example: a drug that is under-strength but that is not used to treat life-threatening situations.</li>
									<li><strong>Class III</strong>: Products that are unlikely to cause any adverse health reaction, but that violate FDA labeling or manufacturing laws. Examples include: a minor container defect and lack of English labeling in a retail food.</li>
								</ul>
